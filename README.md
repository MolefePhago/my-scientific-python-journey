# Scientific Computing with Python Projects


This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The course focuses on building foundational Python skills through hands-on programming challenges.



## âœ… Completed Projects

# 1. Caesar Cipher
A simple implementation of the classic Caesar cipher encryption technique. It shifts each letter in the input text by a specified number of positions down the alphabet.

- **Concepts used:** String manipulation, ASCII values, loops, conditional logic
- **Features:**
  - Encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom shift
  - Preserves capitalization
  - Ignores non-alphabet characters 



# ðŸ“š Upcoming Projects (To Be Added)
- Arithmetic Formatter  
- Time Calculator  
- Budget App  
- Polygon Area Calculator  
- Probability Calculator
